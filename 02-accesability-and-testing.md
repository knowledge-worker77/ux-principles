# Make your UIs easier

There are already built controls available for each task that a user can perform. Use them accordingly and don't invent your own new controls that users don't know how to use.

Make your designs by keeping edge-cases in mind. Use simple words instead of software terminology.  

You can make processes like image uploading easier by providing a minimalist UI with only to options to upload media from their gallery or open the camera.

E-commerce apps should be straight forward, Include a three-step process so that it's easier for both the user to buy things and for you to sell more products. 

- User selects a product.
- Adds it to his cart
- Checks out.

If there are any distractions between these steps than there is a high chance that you might lose the customer.

## Testing

A/B and beta testing is a crucial step for any product or app to be successful today. First launch a beta version to get the public's opinion about your app and remove any bugs that are present before the final launch.

## Mobile-first design

The splash screen of your app should be simple and only should include the icon or logo of your app.
Use a slide-in navigation if there are multiple items in your menu. If there are less than five than use a bottom navigation.
