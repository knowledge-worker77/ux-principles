## Fonts and Typography

If you are adding a custom font to your design make sure that you have a fallback font to use while the custom one loads or isn't available. The best fallback font will be the default font that is installed on the device of the user. Meaning the default fonts of the operating system.

Don't use more than two font types in your typography so that your user doesn't get distracted. Headings and sub-headings should properly to direct the user to the most important things first. Using a font size of 16px and a line-height of 1.5 is considered the gold standard for text in user-interface design.

## Buttons, Menus, and other controls

When designing buttons or other controls, keep in mind that they should look like real life buttons. The whole button should be clickable, add a depth feel when the button is pressed, and the text should be straight forward(click here, Add...)

Always ask the user two times if he is going to perform a critical action like deleting an item or removing items. This can be useful when designing dashboards or e-commerce sites.

Include the top navigation in the footer section as well, Since the footer is the last section in a webpage don't make the footer a dead-end section and include a search bar or subscribe to newsletter section in it.

Menus should only include seven items. Because humans can't remember more than seven items in a list. (This is a fact confirmed by psychology).If you need to include more than seven items then divide the menu in categories and sub-categories.

Breadcrumbs are also a great way to remind your user where he is located in your app. While Pagination is used when there are finite number of items in a list and infinite scroll is used when you want to display unlimited items to user like a social media feed. Progress bars should be linear and should show an integer value to show much the current task has been completed. Spinner loading bars should show text below or inside them that says *loading...* or *still loading... * This makes the user at ease.

## Adding Icons

All of your icons should be the same style and consistent. Each icon has a meaning. don't misplace icons in your UI and don't use out dated icons for new projects.

Emojis are also a great way to add icons that will be familiar to all types of users. If you're  adding text along with an icon, add it besides the icon and not inside the icon.

## Forms and user-input

Use the native keyboards on mobile devices when building forms, mobile devices have specific keyboard options for some input types.

On-boarding forms should ask for as less information as possible because new users don't want to provide all of their info and just want to use the app.

For simple forms you can use client-side validation instead of server-side. If you are required to do server-side validation make sure the user is aware of it.

There are many simple things that you can do to make your forms look great:

- Don't make them feel congested, especially on mobile devices, Let you forms breath.

- Password fields should automatically hide the input of the user. Have a forgot password link in the sign-in/up section.

- Search should be fast and returns the most relatable content at the top.

- Labels and placeholders both are necessary in forms so that the user knows what data to input in which field.
